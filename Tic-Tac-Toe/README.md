Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe project !! This repository contains two implementations of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe:

- [GUI Implementation](https://github.com/faizanxmulla/python-portfolio/blob/main/Tic-Tac-Toe/GUI/main.py)

- [Text Interface Implementation](https://github.com/faizanxmulla/python-portfolio/blob/main/Tic-Tac-Toe/Text%20Interface/main.py)

## Features of GUI implementation. 

The GUI implementation of this Tic-Tac-Toe project provides a user-friendly graphical interface for playing the game. Here are some of its key features:

1. **Player Names:** Players can enter their names before starting the game, providing a personalized gaming experience.

2. **Interactive Grid:** The game grid is displayed on the canvas, and players can click on the grid cells to make their moves.

3. **Symbols:** The game uses "X" and "O" symbols for the two players, with distinctive colors for each symbol (red for "X" and blue for "O").

4. **Score Tracking:** The GUI implementation keeps track of the scores for both players and the number of ties, making it easy to see who is winning.

5. **Game Over Detection:** The program detects when a player wins, when the game ends in a tie, or when it's still ongoing.

6. **Play Again:** After a game concludes, players can click to start a new game, resetting the board and continuing the fun.

7. **Responsive Design:** The graphical interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal gaming experience on various devices.

8. **Visual Feedback:** The game provides visual feedback for game outcomes, displaying the winner's name and scores.

These features make the GUI implementation a user-friendly and enjoyable way to play Tic-Tac-Toe. Players can compete against each other while keeping track of their performance.
